Severstal steel defect detection

This project is about detecting the differet type of defects present in the steel image. 

We pose this as image segmentation problem and use Unet with efficient net as the back bone to detect the different defect type pixels present in the image.

In the predicted and original masks each defect is encoded in different colours as mentioned below

No defect pixels : Black 

Type1 defects: Hot pink 

Type 2 defects : Hot green 

Type 3 defects : Hot blue 

Type 4 defects : yellow
